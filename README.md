 ## Things to Know

  * Each install of this SmartApp will only support **One** location/structure and the Thermostats, Protects, and Cameras within.
  * This version uses a new token which when we are ready to support it will allow access to Nest cams without needing to completely re-install everything.
  * _The token used with this application is using my 'Works for Nest' distribution *appId* and *secret*._
  __I do not have the ability to see any of your data or who is even using the token__
  * Devices that use html tile will not refresh with going out of the device and back in again.

 ## Advantages
  * Able to add/remove multiples devices from a single SmartApp
  * No need to many enter device serial number and login info in preferences
  * Nest Login info is not stored by the application
  * No need to use 3rd Party Polling apps for device updates
  * One single API call for all Nest devices
  * Since there is only a single poll for all devices, updates are more often
  * The devices look great :smile:
